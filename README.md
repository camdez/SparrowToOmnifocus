# Sparrow-to-Omnifocus

A quick hack (don't expect much) to turn Sparrow emails into Omnifocus tasks as quickly as possible.

The ability to drag Sparrow emails to other applications (added in version 1.3) is a fantastic addition and something I've been waiting for so I can track actionable Sparrow emails in Omnifocus, but the process is too slow and was killing my workflow. Create a task in Omnifocus, type in a name, drag the email to the notes field...slow! With this crappy little app, drag an email onto it, a new task appears in the Quick Entry window. Done.
